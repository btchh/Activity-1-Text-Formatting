        <h2><i>My Story</i></h2>

        <p>
          My name is <b>Paul Lourence F. Reguis</b>, though online I refer to myself as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/d.btchh_/" title="Instagram Profile">d.btchh_</a>. I was born on
          <strong>October 25<sup>th</sup>, 2005</strong>, in the small town of <i>Angono, Rizal</i>, but as of now, I live with my family in <i>Rosario, Batangas</i>. One of my biggest dreams is to
          become a <ins>virtuoso violist</ins>, though right now my focus is simply on surviving college life.
        </p>

        <p>
          My <b>mom</b> was a former <abbr title="Overseas Filipino Worker">OFW</abbr> in <em>Hong Kong</em>. She returned to the Philippines in <strong>2013</strong> to personally take care of me and
          my brother. Meanwhile, my father stayed in <strong>Angono, Rizal</strong>, working as both a <em>tricycle driver</em> and a <em>mechanic</em> to support us. It was my <b>uncle</b> who had
          the biggest influence on my academic path—he’s an <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> professional and encouraged me to pursue <strong>Information Technology</strong> in college,
          assuring me that it would be easier to secure a <b>decent job</b> with his guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          My academic journey began in <strong>2008</strong>, when I enrolled in <strong>Christ the King College of Angono</strong>, where I completed <em>Kinder 1 & 2</em> and <em>Grade 1</em>. In
          <em>Grade 2</em>, I briefly attended <strong>Joaquin Guido Elementary School</strong>, before transferring to <strong><abbr title="Bagong Pook Elementary School">BPES</abbr></strong
          >, where I finished my elementary education. Later, I studied at <strong><abbr title="The Sto. Niño Formation and Science School - Night Class">SNFSS-NC</abbr></strong
          >, completing both <em>Junior High</em> and <em>Senior High</em> under the <mark>STEM</mark> strand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside academics, I am passionate about my <b><em>music</em></b
          >. One of my favorite playlists is
          <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRvW2Ft1up7OUEsdg8WjQjsC2u9xQ3Z8Q&si=UQDxdhYfYr5hUMRh" title="My playlist" target="_blank"> <i>Mood Swings</i> </a>, which I often listen to
          while relaxing or studying. I also enjoy playing <b><i>League of Legends</i></b> and <b><i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB)</i></b
          >. In my free time, I love reading <b>yaoi</b> and <b>bara</b> while listening to music.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started learning the <em>viola</em> and <em>violin</em> in <b>2020</b>, but I paused my practice in <strong>2023</strong> due to personal reasons. These days, I’ve shifted my focus to the
          <b>ukulele</b>, which brings me a different kind of joy and creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of now, I honestly have <b>no clear goal</b> for my future. I’m still figuring things out step by step, and that’s okay. One thing I am certain about, however, is that I am
          <strong><del>planning on getting married</del> not planning on getting married</strong>. For now, I simply want to focus on <em>myself</em>, enjoy the things I love, and see where life takes
          me.
